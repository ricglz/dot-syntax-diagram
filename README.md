# Dot generator

> This tool is not complete and maybe will never be.

The purpose of this tool is given
a [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) syntax file
is able to generate a [Dot](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) text
or file describing the syntax diagram of the language that the PEG is
describing.

## TODO

- [ ] Actually a functional tool
- [ ] Complete all the possible cases for generating the AST based on the
  [Pest](https://pest.rs) syntax
- [ ] Create more parsers for more PEG's libraries (eg. ANTLR)
